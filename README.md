# DS-210-Final-Project
DS 210 Final Project, calculating the distances between cellular towers, connecting them by the shortest distance.
<br>
Here is a link to the dataset I used: https://hifld-geoplatform.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/cellular-towers/explore?location=41.362709%2C-72.899753%2C9.01
<br>
I altered the original data by only including cell towers on the contiguous United States, here is a link to the pdf of that Excel Sheet I used for my project.
<br> <br>
This is the "write-up" portion of the final exam where I will explain my project, including what data I am using, what I am trying to solve, roadblocks, and how I overcame them.
<br> <br>
I used a dataset of 23312 nodes, after removing Cell Towers outside of the contiguous United States.
